        current position (e.g., for DirectionalGhost).  However, this is not a problem,
        as Pacman's current position is known.

        In order to obtain the distribution over new positions for the
        ghost, given its previous position (oldPos) as well as Pacman's
        current position, use this line of code:

        of the variable that you have used to refer to the previous ghost
        position for which you are computing this distribution. You will need to compute
        multiple position distributions for a single update.

        newPostDist[p] = Pr( ghost is at position p at time t + 1 | ghost is at position oldPos at time t )

        (and also given Pacman's current position).  You may also find it useful to loop over key, value pairs

        As an implementation detail (with which you need not concern
        yourself), the line of code at the top of this comment block for obtaining newPosDist makes
        use of two helper methods provided in InferenceModule above:

          1) self.setGhostPosition(gameState, ghostPosition)
              This method alters the gameState by placing the ghost we're tracking
              in a particular position.  This altered gameState can be used to query
              what the ghost would do in this position.

          2) self.getPositionDistribution(gameState)
              This method uses the ghost agent to determine what positions the ghost
              will move to from the provided gameState.  The ghost must be placed
              in the gameState with a call to self.setGhostPosition above.

        It is worthwhile, however, to understand why these two helper methods are used and how they
        combine to give us a belief distribution over new positions after a time update from a particular position

              prior distribution by calling initializeParticles. After all particles
              are generated randomly, any ghosts that are eaten (have noisyDistance of 0)
              must be changed to the jail Position. This will involve changing each
              particle if a ghost has been eaten.

        ** Remember ** We store particles as tuples, but to edit a specific particle,
        it must be converted to a list, edited, and then converted back to a tuple. Since
        this is a common operation when placing a ghost in the jail for a particle, we have
        provided a helper method named self.getParticleWithGhostInJail(particle, ghostIndex)
        that performs these three operations for you.

        To loop over the ghosts, use:

          for i in range(self.numGhosts):
            ...

        Then, assuming that "i" refers to the index of the
        ghost, to obtain the distributions over new positions for that
        single ghost, given the list (prevGhostPositions) of previous
        positions of ALL of the ghosts, use this line of code:

          newPosDist = getPositionDistributionForGhost(setGhostPositions(gameState, prevGhostPositions),
                                                       i, self.ghostAgents[i])

        **Note** that you may need to replace "prevGhostPositions" with the
        correct name of the variable that you have used to refer to the
        list of the previous positions of all of the ghosts, and you may
        need to replace "i" with the variable you have used to refer to
        the index of the ghost for which you are computing the new
        position distribution.

        As an implementation detail (with which you need not concern
        yourself), the line of code above for obtaining newPosDist makes
        use of two helper functions defined below in this file:

          1) setGhostPositions(gameState, ghostPositions)
              This method alters the gameState by placing the ghosts in the supplied positions.

          2) getPositionDistributionForGhost(gameState, ghostIndex, agent)
              This method uses the supplied ghost agent to determine what positions
              a ghost (ghostIndex) controlled by a particular agent (ghostAgent)
              will move to in the supplied gameState.  All ghosts
              must first be placed in the gameState using setGhostPositions above.

              The ghost agent you are meant to supply is self.ghostAgents[ghostIndex-1],
              but in this project all ghost agents are always the same.
